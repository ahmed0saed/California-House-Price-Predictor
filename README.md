# üè° California House Price Predictor

This project is a deep learning model built to predict the median house value for residential blocks in California based on various features. The entire project was developed in a Google Colab notebook and includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a simple web interface for live predictions.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and scales the data for optimal model performance.
* **Deep Learning Model**: A sequential neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras.
* **Performance Evaluation**: The model is evaluated on unseen test data to measure its accuracy.
* **Interactive Demo**: A simple web interface built with Gradio to make live predictions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **TensorFlow / Keras**: For building and training the neural network.
* **Scikit-learn**: For data preprocessing (scaling, splitting).
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Gradio**: For creating the interactive web UI.
* **Google Colab**: As the development environment.
